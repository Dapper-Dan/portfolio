            Hi, I'm Daniel Lancaster. I'm a full stack developer based out of the San Francisco Bay Area in California. 
            I have a passion for everything front-end and a knack for design. In my free time I enjoy traveling, snowboarding, going on adventures 
            with my dog family, and playing RPGs.
          </p>

          <h1>My Story</h1>
          <p>
            I've always had a fascination with the workings behind every day things, the mysteries of science and technology. As a child I would take apart VCRs, appliances, anything I could get my hands and see what made them tick. 
            As a teenager, I was building modified gaming consoles out of the parts from other consoles. As an adult, I studied mechanical engineering at California State Univeristy Chico. 
            After college, I started traveling and exploring the Earth's mysteries. I worked within the travel industry around the world and settled down in San Francisco, California where I managed an international hostel for 4 years. 
            My path eventually led me to the stage craft industry where I collaborated with various companies and teams to build festivals, concerts, and large scale technology conventions. After a long period of attending conventions by Google, Apple, and other giants 
            and seeing all of these developers being in the culture I loved and having my dream profession, I took a leap and applied to a top-tier web development bootcamp. I have since graduated and continue to build new applications and expand my arsenal of skills.
